    "# Snake Game in Python using Pygame\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and Pygame. Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. The Snake game consists of a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with its own body.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup and Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pygame.init()`: Initializes Pygame.\n",
    "- Constants for screen width and height, grid size, frames per second (FPS), and color definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Snake Class\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Snake` class represents the snake in the game.\n",
    "  - `__init__`: Initializes the snake with default settings.\n",
    "  - `get_head_position`: Returns the position of the snake's head.\n",
    "  - `update`: Updates the snake's position based on its direction.\n",
    "  - `reset`: Resets the snake to its initial state.\n",
    "  - `render`: Draws the snake on the game surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Food Class\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Food` class represents the food that the snake eats.\n",
    "  - `__init__`: Initializes the food with default settings.\n",
    "  - `randomize_position`: Randomly places the food on the screen.\n",
    "  - `render`: Draws the food on the game surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constants for different directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Function\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initializes Pygame clock, screen, and surface.\n",
    "- Creates instances of `Snake` and `Food`.\n",
    "- Game loop:\n",
    "  - Handles Pygame events, such as quitting and key presses.\n",
    "  - Updates the snake's position.\n",
    "  - Checks if the snake has eaten the food and adjusts its length.\n",
    "  - Renders the game surface with the snake and food.\n",
    "  - Updates the display and controls the game's frame rate using the clock.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Game\n",
    "\n",
    "- The game starts by calling the `main()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customization\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can customize the game further by adding features or improving graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to experiment with the code and add your own enhancements to make the game more interesting!\n"
